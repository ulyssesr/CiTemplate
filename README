Welcome to my CodeIgniter Template. The purpose of this template to quickly get a CI project started. It comes with the standard views and database functions. You'll find a sample controller, model and several views. I'm using Jerome Jaglale's templating system and Ben Edmunds ion-auth for authentication. Thanks for visiting.
